  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  
  <p>A hardcoded html and css clone of Google's homepage. And it actually works!</p>
  
  <h2>What does it do?</h2>
  
  <p>It's google...</p>
  
  <h2>Abstraction. (...or whatever it's called.)</h2>
  
  <p>I'll be the first to admit that front-end isn't my strong suit. And one may think that of all webpages to try and clone, Google's probably the easiest! That may be true, but this was such a wonderful excercise of attention to detail. Some of the CSS elements required down-to-the-pixel specificty. Take the iconic searchbar for example:</p>
  
  <pre>
    #searchbar input {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
    padding: 5px 8px 0 6px;
    border: 2px;
    border-style: inset;
    font-size: 18px;
    height: 25px;
    width: 496px;
    }
  </pre>
  
  <p>Of course, this kind of dexterity isn't arbitrary. I had a wonderful introduction to my browser's devtools to inspect html elements and css rules. Also, does it count as an api if I send a <code>q</code> string to <code>https://www.google.com</code>?</p>
  
  <h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
  
  <p>This project is complete, but more like it are surely to come. Cloning webpages in this was is great practice for frontend skills for me. It wouldn't hurt to go back and refactor this page, however...</p>
  
  <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
  
  <p>HTML, CSS, Devtools, as I've already mentioned. I also learned some softskills too: being patient, precise, and using Google! (pun intended).</p>
