        I am a professional actor turned self-taught web developer living in NYC. I fell in love with Ruby for not only it's logical ease, but for it's community. I began studying with a bit of a chip on my shoulder having not gone to school for Computer Science, and having professed career goals which lie outside of the web development field, but already I've been met with such warmth, passion, collaboration, and creativity amonst Rubyist, that it reminds me of my most favored experiences performing with amazing artists and techncians. <br><br> By my own admission, I won't call myself a web developer quite yet; however, as I grow, refocus, design, scrap, build, and discover all the brilliance in this field, I take time to pause. I am inspired by knowledge, spurred by an impetus for expression, and channeled by technical precision. I aim to build digital stories through minimalistic visual experiences, rich brands, and seamless interactivity. Though I haven’t been a developer for long, I’m on a humble flight.
