  <h2>What is this?</h2>
  
  <p>This is my progress as I work through the famous Michael Hartl Ruby on Rails Tutorial.</p>
  
  <h2>What does it do?</h2>
  
  <p>It helps me learn Rails! Eventually it will be another clone of the famed social media app.</p>
  
  <h2>Abstraction. (...or whatever it's called.)</h2>
  
  <p>Many many many Rails developers have built this app following this tutorial. I feel as though it's a right of passage. Alongside the suppliments at The Odin Project, I feel as though I will complete this tutorial with a more in-depth appreciation for what I've let myself get into.</p>
  
  <h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
  
  <p>I keep on learning! Next up: Models. Keep up with my learning by following <a href="https://github.com/Thomascountz/sample_app" target="none">my repository</a> on github!</p>
  
  <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
  
  <p>So far I'm learning minitest from square one, where in the past I've focused exclusively on RSpec. The tutorial begins with looking at the C and V of MVC, and takes care to ensure that each element is tested.</p>
